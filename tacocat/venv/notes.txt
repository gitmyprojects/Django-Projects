media cdn and static cdn, we created because we are hosting the files on the local server.
normally when a site goes into production, the static files would be stored on a cloud service
such as AWS (amazon web service)

anytime you see an import from django, that is a built-in django classs so you can just google the class
to see how it works and understand more.
     when that built-in class is being passed in as a parameter of a class that is created, you are
     extending that built-in class AND overwriting some of its features.


the header.html template contains notes regarding bootstrap style classes such as md-4 (medium-4)
